Isabella,allergic transfusion reaction rash after blood transfusion,"The AE ""allergic transfusion reaction rash after blood transfusion"" suggests a reaction that occurred as a result of a blood transfusion, which is an allergic response. The key elements here are ""allergic"", ""transfusion"", and ""reaction"". While terms like ""Allergic skin reaction"", ""Immune-mediated rash"", and ""Allergic rash"" capture the allergic and skin aspects, they do not specifically mention the context of a transfusion. Terms like ""Systemic allergic reaction"" and ""Anaphylactic transfusion reaction"" could be relevant, but ""Systemic allergic reaction"" is broader and does not specifically relate to transfusions, and ""Anaphylactic transfusion reaction"" implies a severity (anaphylaxis) that is not explicitly mentioned in the AE. ""Transfusion reaction"" is relevant but does not specify the allergic nature of the reaction. ""Transfusion-related immunomodulation reaction"" is not directly relevant as it implies a modulation of the immune system which is not the focus of the described AE. ""Rash at site of injection"" and ""Infusion site rash"" are not directly relevant as the reaction is described in the context of a blood transfusion, not an injection or infusion.",Allergic transfusion reaction,0-13-869594a9cbdf,Mosaic_output__full__Isabella.json
Isabella,hematoma right shoulder/upperarm,"The AE ""hematoma right shoulder/upperarm"" indicates a hematoma located in the shoulder or upper arm area. Given the location, we can rule out terms related to abdominal or splenic hematomas. The term ""hematoma"" is too general, while ""hematoma NOS"" (not otherwise specified) might be considered if no more specific term is available. However, since the location is specified as the shoulder/upper arm, we should look for terms that relate to this area. ""Shoulder haemarthrosis"" and ""Shoulder hemarthrosis"" seem to be relevant, but ""haemarthrosis"" typically refers to bleeding into a joint, which might not be the case here since the AE does not explicitly mention a joint. ""Hematoma muscle"" could be a consideration since the upper arm has significant muscle tissue, but it's less specific to the shoulder area. ""Subcutaneous hematoma"" could also be a possibility since it refers to a hematoma under the skin, which could occur in the shoulder or upper arm area. However, the most specific term to the area mentioned without assuming the hematoma is strictly subcutaneous or in a joint would be a term that directly",Hematoma NOS,0-82-75e3596e808f,Mosaic_output__full__Isabella.json
